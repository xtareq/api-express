# APi Express
Hello guys. Today we're going to built a very basic rest api application using Express js and mysql with basic authorization. 

# Todos 
- [] Initialize Project 
- [] Install dependencies and libraries
- [] Route Setup
- [] Database integration 
- [] Model Setup
- [] Controller Setup
- [] Authentication
- [] Authorization Middleware

## Installation
Lets install our dependencies 

```sh
    npm init -y # we'll change things later in package.json
    npm install express dotenv --save # yarn add express dotenv
```

To run server we'll update package.json. To continues update we need to install another package called nodemon

```sh
    npm install nodemon --save-dev # yarn add nodemon -D
```

so its working fine. Lets install our other packages

```sh
    npm install mysql2 sequelize # yarn add mysql2 sequelize  
```

Our database is ready lets now connect it with our application

so database connected now

## Models
We'll have only two model for our tiny project one for todo and other is user.


## Other Packages

```sh 
    npm install ex-helpers # yarn add ex-helpers
    # also need jsonwebtoken for authentication 
    npm install jsonwebtoken # yarn add jsonwebtoken
```
